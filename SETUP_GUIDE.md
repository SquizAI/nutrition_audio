# 🚀 Enhanced Nutrition App Setup Guide

## ✅ **Compilation Status: FIXED**
All missing functions have been restored and the app now compiles successfully!

## 🎭 **ElevenLabs Voice Setup (Recommended)**

For human-like voice responses instead of robotic OpenAI voice:

1. **Get ElevenLabs API Key:**
   - Visit: https://elevenlabs.io/
   - Sign up for free account (10,000 characters/month free)
   - Go to Profile → API Keys
   - Copy your API key

2. **Add to Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file in my-nutrition-app directory
   echo "VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

3. **Restart Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🍎 **USDA Nutrition Data (Optional)**

For accurate nutrition lookup instead of estimates:

1. **Get USDA API Key:**
   - Visit: https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html
   - Sign up for free
   - Get your API key

2. **Add to .env file:**
   ```bash
   echo "VITE_USDA_API_KEY=your_usda_api_key_here" >> .env
   ```

## 🤖 **OpenAI Setup (Required)**

The app requires OpenAI API access for chat functionality.

## 🧪 **Testing Your Enhanced System**

Once API keys are configured, test these features:

### 1. **Smart Food Tracking**
- Say: *"I just ate an apple"* 
- Should detect current time and log automatically

### 2. **Natural Language**
- Say: *"I had lunch yesterday"*
- Should parse time and meal type intelligently

### 3. **Multi-Agent Intelligence**
- Ask: *"What's my nutrition progress?"*
- Should activate analytics agent

### 4. **Voice Quality**
- Test both voice modes (AI Voice vs Human Voice toggle)
- ElevenLabs should sound much more natural

## 🎯 **Key Features Now Working**

✅ **Smart Timestamp Detection** - Natural language time parsing  
✅ **Multi-Agent System** - Specialized AI agents working together
